PointSystemDesc

Important:
    Points are confidential, the only person who should have access to them holistically is the points coordinator.
    However, a debater at any time can request to know their personal point total. But not anyone else's >:(

What are points?
    They play a large factor in determining whether you will get a spot for a tournament.
    You and your partner's point total are added up to determine qualifiers (see qualifier below) at a tournament.

How to collect points?
1. You can go to tournaments either as a judge or a competitor. Based on your performance at that tournaments (as a
    judge or debater)
2. You can obtain service points by hosting and participating at Hart House events. These are capped at 30 points.
    Only get service points from two most recent semesters.

The time-length of points:
    Your points from your 4 most recent semesters are the only things that count
    You can only take max 2 semesters off from debating
    If you haven't debated for 2 years total, you get a multiplier

Qualifiers (two types):
1. Qualifiers without tryouts
    These qualifiers are based solely on team point total
2. Qualifiers with tryouts (I truly don't have the effort to explain this; here is the link, go to page 21, good luck)
